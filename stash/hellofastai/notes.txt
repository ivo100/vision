For analyzing stock candle charts, here's a comparative breakdown:
ResNet:

Better for deeper, more complex feature extraction
More parameters, potentially more suitable for detailed chart patterns
Works well with larger input sizes
Good at capturing intricate spatial relationships
Computationally more expensive

EfficientNet:

More parameter-efficient
Designed for balanced network scaling
Better performance-to-complexity ratio
Lighter computational requirements
Might be more suitable for mobile/edge deployments

Recommendations:

Start with ResNet-34 or ResNet-50 for detailed chart analysis
Try EfficientNet-B0 or B2 as a lighter alternative
Input size considerations:

224x224: Standard starting point
500x500: Will capture more chart detail but increases computational cost
Experiment with padding, scaling, or cropping strategies

# Try both architectures with your data
resnet_model = models.resnet50(weights=None)
efficientnet_model = models.efficientnet_b2(weights=None)

# Modify final classification layer for your specific task
resnet_model.fc = nn.Linear(resnet_model.fc.in_features, num_classes)
efficientnet_model.classifier[1] = nn.Linear(efficientnet_model.classifier[1].in_features, num_classes)

Transfer learning typically involves using pre-trained weights from a large dataset (like ImageNet) and fine-tuning them for a specific task. However, "transfer learning without pre-trained weights" might seem counterintuitive, but it has some interesting nuances:
The concept involves:

Leveraging the architectural design of successful networks
Using initialization techniques that benefit from learned insights
Exploiting proven network structures that capture hierarchical features

Practically, this means:

Using a standard network architecture (ResNet, EfficientNet)
Initializing weights carefully (not completely randomly)
Potentially freezing early layers during initial training
Allowing the network to learn from your specific dataset's characteristics

# Standard model initialization
model = models.resnet50(weights=None)

# Strategic weight initialization
def custom_weight_init(m):
    if isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d):
        # Use Kaiming initialization
        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(m.weight, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='relu')
    elif isinstance(m, nn.BatchNorm2d):
        nn.init.constant_(m.weight, 1)
        nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)

# Apply custom initialization
model.apply(custom_weight_init)

# Optional: Freeze early layers initially
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Unfreeze later layers for fine-tuning
for param in model.layer3.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
for param in model.layer4.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True

Key benefits for your stock chart analysis:

Structured network design
Efficient feature learning
Potentially faster convergence
Reduced overfitting risk


Let me clarify the weight initialization concept in simpler terms.
When you create a neural network from scratch, the initial weights can be set in different ways:

Completely Random Initialization (Default)

pythonCopymodel = models.resnet50(weights=None)  # Weights are randomly initialized

Weights start as random numbers
Network learns everything from scratch
Can lead to slower convergence or training instability


Careful Initialization Techniques

pythonCopy# Using Kaiming (He) initialization
def init_weights(m):
    if isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d):
        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(m.weight)
    elif isinstance(m, nn.BatchNorm2d):
        nn.init.constant_(m.weight, 1)
        nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)

model.apply(init_weights)

Uses mathematical strategies to set initial weights
Helps prevent vanishing/exploding gradients
Provides a more stable starting point for learning

Practical Advice:

For your stock chart project, start simple
Use the default random initialization
Focus on:

Data quality
Model architecture
Training process

Advanced initialization can come later
